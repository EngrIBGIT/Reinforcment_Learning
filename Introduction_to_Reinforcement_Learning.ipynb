        "# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns how to interact with an environment in order to achieve a goal. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions. Through trial and error, the agent learns the best sequence of actions to maximize its total rewards. This technique is widely used in applications such as game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), robotic control, and autonomous systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Concepts**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `Agent:` The entity that interacts with the environment (e.g., a robot, game player, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `Environment:` The system with which the agent interacts (e.g., the game board, the physical world).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. `Action (A):` The choices the agent can make (e.g., moving a piece in a game, turning left or right).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. `State (S):` The current situation of the agent in the environment (e.g., the current configuration of the game board).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. `Reward (R):` The feedback the agent receives for its action. Positive rewards encourage the agent to take similar actions in the future, while penalties discourage them."
